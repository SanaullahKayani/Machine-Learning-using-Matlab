# Machine Learning Specialization - Course Assignments

This repository contains the coding assignments I completed as part of the **Machine Learning Specialization** offered by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online on Coursera. The course is taught by Andrew Ng, a pioneer in the AI field. 

The repository consists of 8 assignments, each with its corresponding Python code and PDF documentation.

## Course Overview
This beginner-friendly program provides a foundational understanding of machine learning, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. 

### Key Topics Covered
- Building machine learning models using Python and libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Supervised learning techniques, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
- Handling multiple input features, feature scaling, feature engineering, and polynomial regression.
- Addressing overfitting with techniques like regularization.

### Course Modules
#### **Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning**
- Overview of machine learning and its real-world applications.
- Building supervised learning models for prediction and classification tasks.

#### **Module 2: Linear Regression**
- Extending linear regression to multiple input features.
- Techniques for improving model training and performance.
- Hands-on coding implementation of linear regression.

#### **Module 3: Logistic Regression and Regularization**
- Predicting categories using logistic regression.
- Understanding and addressing overfitting through regularization.
- Practical implementation of logistic regression with regularization.

### About the Instructor
**Andrew Ng** is an AI visionary who has led groundbreaking AI research at Stanford University, Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing.AI. This course is an updated version of his original Machine Learning course, rated 4.9 out of 5, and taken by over 4.8 million learners.

### Specialization Highlights
